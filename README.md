# School Management System - PHP MVC Project
### Overview
This is a School Management System project developed using PHP and following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The system aims to provide an efficient and organized platform for managing various aspects of a school, including student information, teacher details, courses, grades, and attendance records. The MVC pattern helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

### Features
Student Management: Keep track of student information, including their personal details, academic performance, and attendance records.

**Teacher Management:** Maintain a database of teachers, their contact information, and the subjects they teach.

**Course Management:** Create and manage various courses offered by the school, including course details, prerequisites, and scheduling.

**Attendance Tracking:** Allow teachers to mark student attendance, and provide administrators with attendance reports.

**Grades and Progress:** Record and manage student grades, allowing teachers and parents to monitor students' academic progress.

**User Roles:** Implement different user roles (e.g., administrator, teacher, student, parent) with specific permissions to access and modify relevant sections of the system.

**Security:** Implement necessary security measures to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.

**Dashboard:** Provide a comprehensive dashboard for users to get an overview of important information and access relevant features.

Project Structure
The project follows the standard MVC architecture, which is organized into the following directories:

**app:** Contains the core application files.

**views:** the "views" directory contains the view files. Views are responsible for representing the user interface and displaying data to users.


**Controllers:** Holds the controller files responsible for handling user requests and interactions.
Models: Contains the model files that interact with the database and handle data operations.
Views: Consists of view files responsible for displaying data to users.
config: Holds configuration files, such as database configuration and application settings.

**public:** Contains the publicly accessible files for the application, including CSS, JavaScript, and image assets.

**vendor:** Includes the third-party libraries and dependencies used in the project.

**database:** Contains database migration files and seeds to set up the initial database schema and sample data.
